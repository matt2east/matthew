    <p>Steve Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. He is widely considered a to be a brilliant businessman, as well
as one of the greatest tech visionaries on our time.</p>
    
    <p>The story of his life is nothing short of fascinating. After dropping out of college, he started Apple with his friend
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a> in 1976 at the age of 21. The duo gained wealth and fame a year later for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II<title>apple 2</title></a>, one of the first
highly successful mass-produced personal computers. This was followed by the very successful Macintosh in 1984,
the first mass-produced computer with a GUI (graphical user interface). After being ousted of Apple in 1985, he went
on to oversee the creation of two new comapnies: NeXT computer and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar">Pixar</a>. With the success of the movie Toy Story,
Steve became a billionaire.</p>
    <p>In 1997, Steve returned to Apple. Bill Gates and Microsoft dominated the computer industry, and Apple was on the
brink of extinction. Nonetheless, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field">Steve was a fantastic salesman,</a> and used his business acumen to slowly bring the
company back to profitability.</p>
