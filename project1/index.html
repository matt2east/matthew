<h1>About Jon Arbunkle</h1>
    <img src="jon-arbuckle.png" alt="picture of Jon Arbunkle"> <br> <br> <br>
<p>Hi there everyone! My name is <u>Jon Arbunkle</u>. I am 30 years old and I am a cartoonist that lives in Muncie, Indiana. I am the proud owner of a cat named <strong>Garfield</strong> and a dog named <b>Odie</b>. Garfield is fat, lazy and loves to eat, while Odie is a dog without a brain. Although my pets drive me <i>crazy,</i> I can't imagine life without them.</p>
<p>I spend about half my time going to the grocery store to buy enough food to feed Garfield. I have to make sure to buy all of Garfield's favorite foods, or else he'll get grumpy. This includes milk, cheese, bread, ham, chicken wings, potato chips, pasta with marinara sauce, frozen pizzas, and <b>lots and lots</b> of lasanga. When 
come home, Garfield usually attacks me and tries to eat everything in the grocery bag before I even have time
to put it in the refrigerator. One time he ate everything that I bought in 30 seconds, and I had to go back to
the store to buy more food. I <i>wasn't too happy about that.</i></p>
